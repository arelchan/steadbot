# McKinsey page anatomy, from primary sources

Derived from three real engagement decks (not marketing material, not memory):

- USPS, "Future business model" (2010, 39pp, navy era) — usps.com
- DECC UK, "Capturing the full electricity efficiency potential of the UK" (2012, 129pp, the density reference) — gov.uk
- Polish Insurance Association keynote (2014, 25pp, bright-blue era) — piu.org.pl

This is the definition of done for flagship direction 1 (dense data / consulting).
Checklist items marked [gate] are mechanically checkable; the rest is review.

## 1. Page architecture (every content page)

```
kicker (gray, small, top left: current section name)
ACTION TITLE (navy/blue, bold, 1-2 lines, full-sentence claim)
[exhibit zone: 60-100% width, boxed]      [side panel: drivers/implications]
numbered footnotes (small, above source bar)
SOURCE: ... (full-width gray band)            McKinsey & Company | page-no
```

- [gate] The kicker names the CURRENT section and matches the tracker. It is
  typography only: small, gray, sentence case, no counter dressing.
- [gate] Action title is a full sentence with a verb, max 2 lines. Reading all
  titles in sequence must reproduce the storyline without opening a single
  exhibit (the USPS deck passes this test page by page).
- Titles may continue across consecutive pages: "... with similar savings from
  a private sector perspective" (UK deck). The ellipsis is literal.
- [gate] Every content page carries a SOURCE line; assumptions move into a
  "Note:" line above it. Footnotes are numbered, with superscript markers in
  the exhibit ("2009²").

## 2. Exhibit conventions

- Exhibits are BOXED: a light-blue header band carrying the exhibit title
  (bold, blue) plus a unit line in gray ("$ billions", "Billions of pieces").
  The chart never floats naked on the page.
- The default content page is TWO-PANEL: exhibit left (about 60-65%), boxed
  side panel right ("Key drivers", "PAEA implications", "Comments") with the
  same header-band treatment and square bullets.
- Chart annotation is a first-class device: white callout boxes with a leader
  triangle pointing at the data ("No rate increase 2003-2006", "Postal Act
  2006 signed into law"). Annotations explain causes ON the chart.
- Values sit on the data: above bars, inside stacked segments (white on dark),
  at line endpoints. Axes carry years/categories only; no gridline forests.
- Legends are compact swatch rows, top of exhibit or top right of the page.
- Corner context chip (UK deck): a small framed tag top right ("2030, PRIVATE
  SECTOR") when a page belongs to a scenario or cut.
- Secondary numeric strips: pill-shaped value chips under the chart for a
  second measure (USPS RHB row).

## 3. Structure furniture

- Contents/tracker page: vertical color band left, square-bullet section list,
  the CURRENT section highlighted with a light-blue band. The page repeats at
  each section break with the highlight moved.
- The kicker on every content page is the running version of that tracker.
- Closing pages state requirements/decisions, not "thank you".

## 4. Ledger pages (the Poland pattern)

For qualitative content: a two-column ledger ("Trends | Description") with
underlined blue column headers, numbered circle badges per row, a small
functional image or chip per row, dashed row separators, and body bullets that
use INLINE BLUE EMPHASIS on the load-bearing phrase while the rest stays ink.
This is how a consulting page carries prose without becoming a text wall.

## 5. Color and type discipline

- White page. One blue family does everything: navy ink for titles, mid blue
  for emphasis and data, light blue for surfaces (header bands, highlights).
  The 2010 deck is navy+powder; 2012 adds cyan; 2014 runs brighter blue.
  Pick ONE register per deck and never decorate outside it.
- [gate] No decoration: no gradients, no rounded corners, no shadows, no icon
  parades, no stock-photo moods. The Poland thumbnails are functional row
  anchors, not decoration.
- Square bullets, en-dash sub-bullets, sentence case everywhere.
- Density lives in the EXHIBIT, not the type: the UK abatement page carries
  about 60 labels at readable size inside one chart while the page skeleton
  (title, source, page number) stays calm.

## 6. Evidence posture

- Forecast vs actual shown together (USPS volume page); scenarios labelled.
- "Illustrative" / "Preliminary" stamps where data is not hard.
- Comments/assumption boxes carry the caveats next to the data they qualify.

## Gap audit against our seeds (2026-06-11)

| Convention | mckinsey (dev) | consulting (ship) | opex (ship) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kicker + tracker pair | kicker only, no tracker page | section label in foot, no tracker | section label in foot, no tracker |
| Action-title contract | yes (enforced) | yes | yes |
| Boxed exhibit w/ header band + unit line | no, charts float in cards | no | partial (chart card, no band/unit) |
| Two-panel chart+drivers default | partial (split-exhibit type) | no | partial |
| Chart annotation callouts w/ leaders | no (note= only, top-right) | no | no |
| Values inside stacked segments | n/a (no stacked bar in seed) | no | no |
| Numbered footnotes + SOURCE bar | source line only, no footnotes | source line only | source line only |
| Inline blue emphasis in body | no | no | no |
| Ledger w/ badges + dashed separators | no | partial (ledger, no badges) | yes (different register) |
| Corner context chip | no | no | no |
| Contents/tracker slide type | no | no | no |

**Spine decision: rebuild on `mckinsey` (dev seed) as direction-1 flagship.**
It already carries the action-title contract, the density repertoire (15
types) and the navy register; the gaps are furniture (tracker, exhibit bands,
footnotes, callouts, inline emphasis), not architecture. `consulting` stays a
distinct lighter style; `opex` stays the steering-deck register.

**Status 2026-06-11: all gaps closed on the mckinsey seed.** Tracker slide
type (highlight scoped per instance), kicker row + corner context chip on
every content page, boxed exhibits with wash header band + unit line, boxed
drivers panel with square bullets (replacing the bare accent rail), annotation
callouts with leader lines on `chart-line`, numbered footnote zone above the
SOURCE bar, inline `**emphasis**` (engine-level, post-escape), `ledger` type
with circled badges + dashed separators, `chart-stacked` with per-segment
fitted inside values. Fixture: `_dev-skills/_assets/nordwind-deck.json`
(17 slides, 17/17 occupancy, titles-only storyline reads).

## Counted reference density spec (measured 2026-06-11, pdftotext per page)

The first two density passes failed because progress was measured against our
own prior output. These numbers are COUNTED from the reference decks and are
the definition of done — a page is dense when it reaches them, not when it
beats yesterday. Methodology: `pdftotext -f p -l p`, tokens = words, numerals
= `[0-9][0-9.,%]*` matches. Apply the SAME extraction to our rendered HTML
(`scripts/measure-density.mts`).

Per-page text metrics (USPS + Poland engagement decks — the register
direction 1 targets; UK working sessions run 2x higher and are out of scope):

| metric | median content page | standard exhibit | dense exhibit (1–3 per deck) |
|---|---|---|---|
| tokens | ~100 | 80–160 | 150–195 |
| text lines | ~35 | 30–60 | 60–90 |
| numerals | ~20 | 15–45 | 70–112 |

Hard floors for our output: data slides ≥ 80 tokens and ≥ 20 numerals
rendered; deck median across content pages ≥ 90 tokens. Gate thresholds are
derived from these counts, never from our own output.

Where the reference density structurally comes from (counted on USPS p8/p12/
p19/p28, Poland p9):

1. **Y-axis tick scale on EVERY chart** — 6 to 18 tick labels per chart
   (p19 left panel: 17). This alone is the largest single gap vs our output.
2. **X label on every period** (07–20 = 14 labels; no thinning below ~16).
3. **Value on every bar** (10–14 per chart).
4. **Multi-panel pages**: 3 boxed exhibits side by side (p19) or 2 stacked
   (p8), each with its own wash band + unit line.
5. **In-chart series labels with CAGR notes** ("Cost +1.5% p.a.¹") instead of
   a detached legend.
6. **Dashed reference line with marker value** at the right edge ("◀ 15").
7. **Actual/Forecast dashed divider** with zone labels at the top.
8. **Annotation callout boxes with leader lines** (we have these).
9. **Embedded mini-table beside the chart inside the exhibit** (p12 — the
   MEDIAN page does this, it is not an outlier device).
10. **Matrix with a value in every cell + badge summary rows** (Poland p9:
    49 cells + 14 badges).

Out of scope: the UK MACC curve (p77, ~50 labeled waterfall segments) is a
working-session artifact, not the engagement register.

## Canonical test case (fixture)

One honest strategy case, clearly marked illustrative, that forces the full
repertoire: "Nordwind Appliances: should we enter the EU heat-pump market?"

- exec summary (the answer first), context (market line chart, forecast vs
  actual), problem quantified (waterfall), options (2x2), comparison table,
  deep-dive with annotation callouts, ledger page (qualitative trends),
  economics (stacked bar with inside values), risks, roadmap, recommendation
  with decisions/asks, tracker pages between sections.

The fixture must pass titles-only storyline reading, the occupancy gate, and
every [gate] item above.
