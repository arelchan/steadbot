// Content density — the orthogonal axis to design-language.
//
// A skill defines a *presentation type's* visual language (consulting, editorial,
// pitch …). Density is independent of that: it is how much information a single
// slide carries, and it varies PER SLIDE within one deck.
//
// Density is a LAYOUT CHOICE, never a scale knob. It does NOT shrink type to fit
// more in. Type stays readable at all times. A denser slide uses a layout built
// to carry more (columns, a stat grid, a matrix, small-multiples) — each of which
// is designed to look good at readable sizes. If content exceeds what a layout
// holds well, the answer is a richer layout or another slide, never smaller text.
//
// This model is type-agnostic. Each skill translates a tier into its own register
// by offering layouts (slide-types) appropriate to that tier.

CONTENT DENSITY (per slide — varies within the deck)
Every slide carries a "density" field (sibling to "type" and "slots") set to one of: ${DENSITY_TIERS.join(", ")}.
Density is HOW MUCH a slide carries, expressed by CHOOSING THE LAYOUT (slide-type) that fits — never by shrinking type. It MUST vary across the deck: a dense multi-zone slide next to a breathing statement is the point.
${tiers}
Pick the slide-type whose layout matches the density you want, then write content that fills that layout at a readable size without overflowing. If you have more than a layout holds well, use a richer layout or split across slides — do not cram. Choose density from the slide's job, and do not make every slide the same.
