// Deck planner — the brief-grounded planning layer.
//
// The #1 reason decks read as machine-made is that every deck's prompt is the
// same shape: same slide-type list, same generic "vary it" instruction. Only the
// token palette changes. This module reads the brief and derives an EXPLICIT,
// per-deck design read + density rhythm, injected into the system prompt before
// the slide types. Two decks now differ in their marching orders, not just color.
//
// Deterministic and pure. The read is keyword-inferred from the user prompt and
// the skill's own frontmatter — a heuristic, honestly labelled, with a "general"
// fallback when no signal is present. No LLM call, no I/O.

This is not a generic deck. It is ${article(read.presentationType)} ${read.presentationType} for ${article(read.audience)} ${read.audience} audience.
- Narrative arc: ${ARC_GUIDANCE[read.presentationType]}. The deck progresses through this shape; it never circles one beat for half the slides.
- Copy register: ${read.register} — ${REGISTER_GUIDANCE[read.register]}
- Asset appetite: ${read.assetAppetite} — ${APPETITE_GUIDANCE[read.assetAppetite]}
- Design variance: ${read.variance} — ${VARIANCE_GUIDANCE[read.variance]}
- Density rhythm (suggested per-slide density, in order): ${rhythm}
  Follow this rhythm unless the content of a slide clearly calls for another tier. The point is variation: do NOT make every slide the same density.
